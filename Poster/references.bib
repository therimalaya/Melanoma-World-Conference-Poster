PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cohort of 55 patients ({$<$} 25~years of age) prospectively followed from 1995 to 2018 in the Stanford Pigmented Lesion and Melanoma Program was analyzed for differences in clinical presentation, including skin phototype, race/ethnicity, age, sex, tumor/melanoma characteristics, and outcome. RESULTS: Seventeen patients (9 males and 8 females) were classified as nonwhite (predominantly skin phototype IV) and of Hispanic, Asian, or Black/African American ethnicity, and 38 patients (21 males and 17 females) were classified as white (predominantly phototypes I/II). Ages ranged from 6~months to 24~years, and median follow-up was 36~months (range 1-180~months). Melanomas were diagnosed in 87\% of whites in our cohort, compared to 65\% of nonwhites, with the remainder representing mainly atypical Spitz tumors. Lesions were usually brought to the attention of a health care provider by the patient or family (P~{$<~$}0.05). Compared with whites, nonwhites were more likely to present at a younger mean age (10.9~years vs 15.4~years, P~{$<~$}0.05) and with pink/clinically amelanotic tumors (59\% vs 24\%, P~=~0.02). CONCLUSIONS: This long-term prospective institutional study showed clinically relevant differences between nonwhite vs white children, adolescents, and young adults diagnosed with melanoma and atypical melanocytic neoplasms. Nonwhite patients presented at a younger age and had more clinically amelanotic melanocytic tumors. Increased recognition of clinical factors and risk of these tumors in nonwhites could result in earlier diagnosis.},

OBJECTIVE: To determine the difference in 5-year relative survival in patients with NM and SSM at the same Breslow depth and TNM stage. METHODS: A population-based cross-sectional analysis compared the 5-year relative survival of patients with NM and SSM using data from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)*Stat software (version 8.2.1-8.3.5). Chi-square tests compared the proportions, and Kaplan-Meier method with Z-score compared 5-year relative survival. RESULTS: For patients diagnosed between 2004-2009 5-year relative survival was lower in NM compared to SSM (53.7\% vs. 87.3\%, Z score -41.35, p {$<$} 0.001). Similarly, for patients diagnosed between 2010-2015, 5-year relative survival was lower in NM compared to SSM (61.5\% vs. 89.7\%, Z score -2.7078, p {$<$} 0.01). Subgroup analyses showed inferior survival in NM in T1b, and survival differences remained significant after excluding patients with nodal or distant metastases. CONCLUSIONS: Five-year relative survival is worse in NM compared to SSM especially in T1b, T2a, and T2b melanomas. Melanoma subtype should be taken into consideration when making treatment recommendations.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The last 20 years has seen a marked improvement in skin cancer awareness campaigns. We sought to establish whether this has affected the presenting Breslow thickness of malignant melanoma in the South West. METHOD: This is a retrospective study looking at the first presentation of melanomas from 2003 to 2011. Data was accessed using the local online melanoma database. RESULTS: A total of 2001 new melanomas presented from 2003 to 2012 (Male:Female = 1:1.062). The average yearly number of melanomas was 200.1 (range = 138-312). The mean age was 62.5 years (range 12-99). Data was analysed using a Chi² test. For 0-1 mm melanomas, there is a significant difference in the observed versus expected values over the 10 years (p = 0.0018). There is an increasing proportion of 0-1 mm (thin) melanomas presenting year on year, with a positive linear trend. This is very statistically significant (p {$<$} 0.0001). The 1-2 mm melanomas are decreasing in proportion with a negative linear trend (p = 0.0013). The 2-4 mm are also decreasing in proportion (p = 0.0253). There is no significant change in the thick {$>$}4 mm melanomas (p = 0.1456). CONCLUSION: The proportion of thin 0-1 mm melanomas presenting in South West England has significantly increased from 2003 to 2012. There is no significant change in the thick {$>$}4 mm melanomas. This may be a result of increased public awareness due to effective public health campaigns which has significant prognostic and financial implications.},

The 20-year case fatality increased by thickness, with the percentage of melanoma deaths within 20 years of diagnosis being up to 4.8\% for melanomas with measured thickness {$<$}0.80 mm, 10.6\% for tumors 0.8 to {$<$}1.0 mm and generally more than 30\% for melanomas measuring 3 mm and more. For melanomas {$<$}1.0 mm, most deaths occurred between 5 and 20 years after diagnosis, whereas for thicker melanomas the reverse was true with most deaths occurring within the first 5 years. Five-year case fatality decreased over successive calendar time periods for melanomas {$<$}1.0 mm, but not for melanomas ≥1.0 mm. These findings demonstrate that the time course for fatal melanomas varies markedly according to tumor thickness at diagnosis. Improved understanding of the patient factors and characteristics of melanomas, in addition to tumor thickness, which increase the likelihood of progression, is needed to guide clinical diagnosis, communication with patients and ongoing surveillance pathways of patients with potentially fatal lesions.},

METHODS: We analysed incident cases diagnosed with 10 solid tumours included in the UK government target of 75\% of patients diagnosed in TNM stage I/II by 2028. We examined socio-demographic differences in diagnosis at stage III/IV vs. I/II. Multiple imputation was used for missing stage at diagnosis (9\% of tumours). RESULTS: Of the 202,001 cases, 57\% were diagnosed in stage I/II (an absolute 18\% 'gap' from the 75\% target). The likelihood of diagnosis at stage III/IV increased in older age, though variably by cancer site, being strongest for prostate and endometrial cancer. Increasing level of deprivation was associated with advanced stage at diagnosis for all sites except lung and renal cancer. There were, inconsistent in direction, sex inequalities for four cancers. Eliminating socio-demographic inequalities would translate to 61\% of patients with the 10 studied cancers being diagnosed at stage I/II, reducing the gap from target to 14\%. CONCLUSIONS: Potential elimination of socio-demographic inequalities in stage at diagnosis would make a substantial, though partial, contribution to achieving stage shift targets. Earlier diagnosis strategies should additionally focus on the whole population and not only the high-risk socio-demographic groups.},

  abstract = {Introduction The incidence of melanoma of the skin has risen in Denmark in recent decades, the increase being steeper from 2004. It is unclear whether this represents a true rise in incidence or whether it is caused by an increased awareness of the condition. Methods To assess whether the increase was characterised by early-stage melanomas and a higher proportion of melanomas with superficial spreading morphology, we studied all skin melanoma patients registered in the Danish Cancer Register 1989–2011 (n=27,010) and followed up for death through 2013. Trends in age-standardised incidence by sex, subsite and morphology, relative survival, TNM stage distribution and stage-specific relative survival from 2004 were analysed. Results The incidence of melanoma more than doubled over 23 years. A steeper increase from 2004 was driven mainly by superficial spreading tumours, but the proportion of nodular melanomas in patients 50 years of age and over also increased significantly. The largest increase occurred for stage I tumours and for tumours on the trunk. From 1989–1993 to 2009–2011 the 5-year relative survival increased at 12\% and 6\% points for male and female patients, respectively. Interpretation Greater awareness, and thus lower stage at diagnosis (mediated by a large skin cancer prevention campaign from 2007), might explain part of the increase, but the increase in nodular melanoma also points to a genuine increase in the risk of melanoma.},

From 1986 to 2013, overall mortality rates increased by 7.5\%. Beginning in 2011, the US Food and Drug Administration approved 10 new treatments for metastatic melanoma. From 2013 to 2016, overall mortality decreased by 17.9\% (annual percent change [APC]\,=\,−6.2\%; 95\% confidence interval [CI]\,=\,−8.7\%, −3.7\%) with sharp declines among men aged 50 years or older (APC\,=\,−8.3\%; 95\% CI\,=\,−12.2\%, −4.1\%) starting in 2014. This recent, multiyear decline is the largest and most sustained improvement in melanoma mortality ever observed and is unprecedented in cancer medicine.Conclusions. The introduction of new therapies for metastatic melanoma was associated with a significant reduction in population-level mortality. Future research should focus on developing even more effective treatments, identifying biomarkers to select patients most likely to benefit, and renewing emphasis on public health approaches to reduce the number of patients with advanced disease.},

Changes from 1994-1999 to 2010-2014 in tumour and patient  characteristics - sex, age (0-44, 45-64, ≥\,65 years), site (head and neck, trunk,  limbs), morphology (superficial spreading, nodular, other), thickness (≤\,1, 1-2,  2-4, {$>$}\,4) and stage I-II, III-IV - were evaluated. Trends in age-standardized  incidence and mortality rates were evaluated as annual percent change. During the  past two decades, melanoma incidence significantly increased in both sexes (+6\%/year  among men and +4\%/year among women) and in all ages (0-44 years: +\,4.7 and +\,4.3;  45-64 years: +\,6.1 and +\,4.4; ≥65 years: +\,6.6 and +\,1.7), morphologies, except  nodular, and stages. Mortality was stable among men and women. In the area,  incidence increased for thin and thick melanoma, showing a true increase, whereas  mortality did not increase.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate RS of melanoma, stratified by tumor thickness for each histologic subtype, and identify survival trends. METHODS: With use of cancer registry data on melanoma cases (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, codes C43.0-C43.9) diagnosed in Germany in 1997-2013, 5- and 10-year age-standardized RS stratified by histologic subtype and stratified or standardized by T stage was estimated by standard and modeled period analyses. We restricted 10-year RS analyses to patients younger than 75~years. RESULTS: We analyzed 82,901 cases. Overall, the 5- and 10-year RS rates were 91.7\% and 90.8\%, respectively. Prognosis worsened with increasing T stage for all histologic subtypes, but T-stage distribution varied substantially. Survival differences by histologic subtype were strongly alleviated after adjustment for T stage but remained significant. Overall, 5-year RS increased significantly (by 3.8 percentage points) between the periods 2002-2005 and 2010-2013. This increase was no longer seen after adjustment for T stage. LIMITATIONS: Exclusion of cases on account of missing information on T stages, changes in the definition of T stages, and lack of information on screening and treatment limit our analyses. CONCLUSION: Differences in RS between histologic subtypes were strongly mediated by tumor thickness. Over time, RS of melanoma increased as a result of changes in T-stage distribution.},

This publication should help health professionals, policy-makers and researchers to identify and make decisions about areas that need more attention and investigation. This publication may also be valuable for the media, educators and members of the public with an interest in cancer. Due to random variation in incidence rates from one year to another, cancer trends should be interpreted by examining the rates over the past several years. Furthermore, the numbers for 2019 might be slightly underreported due to delayed notification of cancer cases. The present report is published before the complete numbers of deaths in 2019 was received from the Cause of Death Registry, and for this year’s report we have received fewer death certificates than usual. A more detailed estimate of this possible underreporting is given below. The report is available online at: https://www.kreftregisteret.no/},

  abstract = {Over the past two decades, numerous efforts have been initiated to improve screening and early detection of melanoma both in the United States and worldwide. It is commonly believed that these efforts have contributed to the stabilization of melanoma mortality, and that the proportion of thick melanoma with unfavorable prognosis is on the decline. Data obtained from 17 population-based cancer registries of the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Result (SEER) program of the National Cancer Institute for 1988–2006 were used to examine trends in melanoma tumor thickness. For malignant melanoma cases with recorded thickness, the proportionate distribution among four thickness categories (≤1, 1.01–2, 2.01–4, and {$>$}4mm) remained relatively stable over the 19-year study period, however, for melanomas resulting in death, the proportion of thick tumors increased. The most substantial change occurred in the proportion of melanoma in situ, which nearly doubled from 1988 to 2006. Surveillance and early detection efforts in the United States have not resulted in a substantial reduction in the proportion of tumors with prognostically unfavorable thickness. Continued improvement and new methods of screening, especially among demographics with higher incidence of thick tumors, is necessary.},

Methods All residents in a defined area of New Zealand with a biopsy showing a new primary invasive or in situ melanoma from 2010 to 2012 were identified, 974 patients; analysis used multivariate methods. Results Age-standardised incidence rates were 34.3 in females (F) and 41.4 in males (M) for invasive, 20.9 F and 27.6 M for in situ, and 55.2 F and 69.0 M for total melanoma. More in situ melanoma occurred in older patients and on the head and neck. Geometric mean Breslow thickness for invasive was 0.78 mm F and 0.85 mm M, with thicker lesions at ages over 60 and on the lower limb; there was no significant relationship with sex, distance from care or social deprivation assessed from residential address. Nodular melanomas (15\%) were more frequent in older and male patients, and on the limbs, and were thicker. The estimated cumulative risk for melanoma is 4.4\% F and 4.6\% M by age 70. The body site distribution and sex differences were consistent with sun exposure patterns. Estimated incidence of melanoma in New Zealand in 2018 is 2500 invasive and 1700 in situ cases. Conclusions Assessing both in situ and invasive melanoma expands the clinical picture, better estimating health care demand and costs. Results suggest that in situ disease is a more slowly growing lesion than the early phase of invasive disease. The features of thicker or nodular melanoma show priorities for prevention and early detection.},

  abstract = {In Europe as a whole, survival from skin malignant melanoma (SMM) has increased constantly since the 1980s. The aim of the SUDCAN collaborative study was to compare the trends in the 5-year net survival from SMM and in related excess mortality rate between six European Latin countries (Belgium, France, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and Switzerland). The data were extracted from the EUROCARE-5 database (end of follow-up: 01 January 2009). First, the net survival was studied over the 2000–2004 period using the Pohar-Perme estimator. For trend analyses, the study period was specific to each country. The results are reported from 1992 to 2004 in France, Italy, Spain, and Switzerland and from 2000 to 2004 in Belgium and Portugal. The analyses were carried out using a flexible excess rate modeling. Over the 2000–2004 period, the 5-year net survival from SMM ranged from 79 (Portugal) to 90\% (Switzerland). In all countries, net survival was higher in women versus men and in young versus old age groups. From 1992 to 2004, the 5-year net survival increased the most in the countries with the lowest survivals in 1992 (+9\% in Italy and Spain vs. +2\% in Switzerland or +4\% in France). The differences between countries decreased between 1992 and 2004. Although survival increased to a lower or higher extent in all countries during the period studied, significant differences in net survival from SMM persisted among the six countries studied. Health policies should mainly enhance early diagnosis by increasing public awareness and with screening campaigns. Furthermore, new immunotherapies, which will be approved soon hopefully, should also be used to improve the outcomes of SMM treatment.},

  abstract = {Melanoma and keratinocyte skin cancer (KSC) are the most common types of cancer in White-skinned populations. Both tumor entities showed increasing incidence rates worldwide but stable or decreasing mortality rates. Rising incidence rates of cutaneous melanoma (CM) and KSC are largely attributed to increasing exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, the main causal risk factor for skin cancer.Incidence rates of KSC, comprising of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), are much higher than that of melanoma. BCC development is mainly the cause of an intensive UV exposure in childhood and adolescence, while SCC development is related to chronic, cumulative UV exposure over decades. Although mortality is relatively low, KSC is an increasing problem for health care services causing significant morbidity.Cutaneous melanoma is rapidly increasing in White populations, with an estimated annual increase of around 3–7\% over the past decades. In contrast to SCC, melanoma risk is associated with intermittent and chronic exposure to sunlight. The frequency of its occurrence is closely associated with the constitutive color of the skin and the geographical zone. Changes in outdoor activities and exposure to sunlight during the past 70 years are an important factor for the increasing incidence of melanoma. Mortality rates of melanoma show stabilization in the USA, Australia, and in European countries. In the USA even dropping numbers of death cases were recently reported, probably reflecting efficacy of the new systemic treatments.Among younger cohorts in some populations (e.g., Australia and New Zealand,), stabilizing or declining incidence rates of CM are observed, potentially caused by primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure. In contrast, incidence rates of CM are still rising in most European countries and in the USA. Ongoing trends towards thinner melanoma are largely ascribed to earlier detection.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The objective of the current study was to compile prospective, population-based data on cutaneous invasive melanomas in Sweden during the period from 1990 to 1999, to describe and analyze survival data and prognostic factors, and to make comparisons with previously published Swedish and international data. METHODS Twelve thousand five hundred thirty-three patients, which included 97\% of all registered melanomas in Sweden, were included and described. Among these, 9515 patients with clinical Stage I and II melanoma were included in an analysis of survival and in a univariate analysis, and 6191 patients were included in a multivariate analysis of prognostic factors. RESULTS There was no significant change in melanoma incidence during 1990–1999. Favorable prognostic factors were found, especially in younger and female patients, resulting in a relative 5-year survival rate of 91.5\%. In the multivariate analysis, significant factors that had a negative effect on survival were Clark level of invasion, Breslow thickness, ulceration, older patient age, trunk location, greatest tumor dimension, nodular histogenetic type, and male gender. CONCLUSIONS During the period from 1990 to 1999, the 5-year survival of patients with malignant melanoma in Sweden was better compared with the previously reported rates in published, population-based studies from Sweden, probably as a result of better secondary prevention due to better knowledge and awareness by both patients and the medical profession. The more favorable prognostic factors and the change in melanoma location found in younger patients, compared with earlier reports, may reflect changes in clothing as well as tanning habits; however, a decrease also was found in Clark Level II and thin melanomas for the same patient group. The authors concluded that further improvements can be achieved with better access to health care and with the use of early melanoma detection campaigns.

  abstract = {Background: The incidence of malignant melanoma has continually increased during the past few decades, however, certain reports suggest a recent change in trends. The aim of our study was to examine the epidemiology of melanoma in Hungary. Methods: This nationwide, retrospective, longitudinal study included melanoma patients diagnosed between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2019 using the databases of the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) and Central Statistical Office (CSO) of Hungary. Age-standardized incidence and cause-specific mortality rates were calculated. Results: We identified 2,426 and 2,414 new melanoma cases in 2011 and in 2019. Age-standardized incidence rates were higher in males and varied between 28.28 and 34.57/100,000 person-years (PYs), and between 22.63 and 26.72/100,000 PYs in females. We found 16.14\% and 18.82\% increases in male and female incidence rates from 2011 to 2015 (p=0.067 and p{$<$}0.001, respectively), and 12.77\% and 11.35\% decreases from 2015 to 2019 (p=0.062 and p=0.004, respectively). The change of incidence trends (2011–2015 vs. 2015–2019) was significant in females (p=0.002) and in the total melanoma population (p=0.011), but not in the male population (p=0.063). A 16.55\% (95\% CI: -27.07 to -4.59; p=0.013) decrease in mortality rates was found in the overall melanoma population. Conclusions: We observed a significant trend change in melanoma incidence in the female and total melanoma population, and a significant decrease in mortality in the total melanoma population. These changes may be attributed to intensive melanoma awareness campaigns as well as to the increase in screening and access to modern therapies.},

  abstract = {Background Many cancer types display sex and age disparity in incidence and outcome. The mutational load of tumours, including melanoma, varies according to sex and age. However, there are no tools to explore systematically whether clinical variables such as age and sex determine the genomic landscape of cancer. Objectives To establish a mathematical approach using melanoma mutational data to analyse how sex and age shape the tumour genome. Methods We model how age-related (clock-like) somatic mutations that arise during cell division, and extrinsic (environmental ultraviolet radiation) mutations accumulate in cancer genomes. Results Melanoma is driven primarily by cell-intrinsic age-related mutations and extrinsic ultraviolet radiation-induced mutations, and we show that these mutation types differ in magnitude and chronology and by sex in the distinct molecular melanoma subtypes. Our model confirms that age and sex are determinants of cellular mutation rate, shaping the final mutation composition. We show mathematically for the first time how, similarly to noncancer tissues, melanoma genomes reflect a decline in cell division during ageing. We find that clock-like mutations strongly correlate with the acquisition of ultraviolet-induced mutations, but critically, men present a higher number and rate of cell-division-linked mutations. Conclusions These data indicate that the contribution of environmental damage to melanoma likely extends beyond genetic damage to affect cell division. Sex and age determine the final mutational composition of melanoma.},

  abstract = {Incidence and mortality of melanoma have increased among men and women in Europe. We analysed the incidence and mortality of cutaneous melanoma (CM) in Northern Ireland. Three thousand eight hundred and thirty-seven incident cases of CM were reported to the Northern Ireland Cancer Registry (NICR) from 1984 to 2006 and 1177 melanoma deaths occurred from 1955 to 2007. Trends were analysed using joinpoint regression and a negative binomial model was fitted to test the linear trends for incidence adjusted for calendar year, age, sex and Breslow thickness. Age-adjusted incidence rates of CM increased significantly in both men and women (estimated annual percent change (EAPC): 4.8\% and 2.5\%, respectively). The increase was essentially due to thin melanoma ({$<$}1mm). In contrast, there was a stabilisation of incidence of thick melanomas (4mm) in men and suggestion of a decrease in incidence of thick melanomas in women (EAPC: -1.5, 95\% confidence interval (CI) -3.6;0.6). Mortality rates increased steadily in men over the whole period 1955-2004 (EAPC: 1.8\%, 95\% CI 1.1;2.5) whereas in women it increased until 1980 and decreased after (EAPC: -1.0\%, 95\% CI -2.5;0.6). We report for the first time a downward shift in all age mortality after steady increases but for women only. The plausibility of this shift is supported by similar downward trend in thick melanoma incidence in females only. Although there has been an active sun protection programme in Northern Ireland since 1990, the reason for the changes in female mortality which predates the programme remains to be fully understood.},

This was a multicenter, cross-sectional study that recruited between 2000 and 2009 patients with primary in-situ MM (Tis) and invasive cutaneous MM. Tis and MMs with a Breslow's thickness less than 1\,mm (T1) were grouped (Tis-T1) and tumors with a Breslow's thickness 1\,mm or more were also analyzed in combination (T2-T4). The tumor size was measured after routine formalin tissue fixation. Primary outcomes were the correlation between Breslow's thickness and tumor size, and the role of tumor size in explaining variations in Breslow's thickness, as assessed by the Pearson correlation test and logistic binary regression with calculation of the odds ratios. A total of 1610 MM patients were included and analyzed. The Pearson correlation between tumor size and Breslow's thickness was 0.42, with a determination coefficient of R2=0.18 (P{$>$}0.01). Correlations between tumor size and thickness were stronger in patients aged 30-60 years (r=0.42, R2=0.1764, P{$<$}0.001) and in tumors arising on the upper limbs (r=0.55, R2=0.3025). The odds ratio of identifying a T2-T4 stage MM in patients with tumors larger than 1\,cm in size was 2.76 (95\% confidence interval 2.25-3.39, P{$<$}0.001). Even though a direct, positive, and strong association between tumoral size and Breslow's thickness might be expected in melanoma cases, the strength of this association has been moderate. Tumor size explains a low burden of the variation observed in the Breslow's thickness.},

Objective: To test whether observed differences in melanoma incidence between men and women vary by population, age, or anatomic site. Design: Cross-sectional analysis of sex- and site-specific temporal trends in melanoma incidence over 3 decades was conducted for men and women diagnosed with invasive melanoma in the US (limited to white race), Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the UK, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark. Using cancer registry data, male to female incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated overall and by anatomic site, and Joinpoint regression models were used to estimate the annual percentage rate changes in sex- and site-specific incidence in each population. Incidence rates were standardized to the US 2000 population. Data on the incidence between January 1, 1982, and December 31, 2015, were obtained; analysis was conducted from March 1 to October 15, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Male to female IRRs and annual percentage change in rates. Results: Total melanoma incidence was higher in men than women in US individuals (limited to white race), Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, but not in Denmark, the UK, Norway, and Sweden. In all populations, men had higher rates of melanoma of the head and neck and trunk than women (male to female IRR {$>$}1), but lower melanoma rates on the lower limbs (ie, male to female IRR approximately 0.5). The male to female IRR increased log linearly with age, with excess melanomas in women younger than 45 years in all populations (eg, IRR for 20-24 y age group, 0.3 in Denmark and 0.7 in Australia), and excess melanomas in men older than 69 years (eg, IRR for 70-74 y age group, 1.1 in Denmark and 2.1 in the US white population). The age at which the melanoma incidence in men exceeded the melanoma incidence in women differed by population, being achieved the earliest in Australia (45-49 years) and latest in Denmark (65-69 years). Conclusions and Relevance: In predominantly fair-skinned populations, melanoma incidence appears to differ systematically and consistently between men and women by age and anatomic site.},

With an average follow-up of 12.7 years, 581 invasive malignant melanoma (IMM) and 412 melanoma in situ (MIS) cases were identified, of which 107 (IMM) and 74 (MIS) were among non-whites/multiracials. The relative risks (RRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by Cox proportional hazards models using days from cohort entry as the underlying time variable. Among non-white/multiracial males, location of IMM tumors differed from those of white males (p{$<$}0.001); and non-white/multiracial females were more likely to be diagnosed with later stage of disease (p{$<$}0.001). After adjusting for potential confounders, age at cohort entry, male sex, higher education, and sunburn susceptibility phenotypes were associated with an increased risk of invasive malignant melanoma in non-whites/multiracials (p{$<$}0.05). The risk estimates for age at cohort entry and lighter hair and eye color were greater in non-whites/multiracials than in whites (p-heterogeneity=0.062, 0.016, and 0.005, respectively). For MIS risk, RRs between whites and non-whites/multiracials also differed for study location and education (p-heterogeneity ≤ 0.015). In conclusion, similar to whites, age at cohort entry, male sex, and susceptibility to sunburn phenotypes may be predictive of malignant melanoma risk in non-white populations excluding African-Americans.},

The present study aims to present the incidence trends of cutaneous malignant melanoma in Norway, 1954-2008, according to period, sex, age, stage of disease, anatomical location and geographical regions, and discuss the results in relation to sun exposure habits over time. All new cases of invasive cutaneous malignant melanoma diagnosed in the Norwegian population between 1 January 1954 and 31 December 2008 were retrieved from the Cancer Registry of Norway (n=31 783). In addition to descriptive analyses, joinpoint and age-period-cohort regression models were used to explore the incidence trends. Throughout the 1980s, a steep increase in the rate of melanoma was observed in both sexes, continuing to increase from the late 1990s. Age-specific incidence rates showed the steepest increase in age groups older than 50 years, and were most pronounced in men. A clear sex-specific anatomical distribution exists, although the trunk has become the most common location for both sexes. During the entire period of follow-up, a two-fold risk was observed in inhabitants of the southern compared with the northern part of Norway. It is reasonable to suggest that the rising incidence rates of melanoma in Norway, in both sexes, reflect a strengthened intermittent sun exposure pattern over time. The particularly strong incidence increase in older men corresponds with their less favourable sun-protective behaviour.},

  abstract = {Background New Zealand and Australia have the highest melanoma incidence rates worldwide. In New Zealand, both the incidence and thickness have been increasing. Clinical decisions require accurate risk prediction but a simple list of genetic, phenotypic and behavioural risk factors is inadequate to estimate individual risk as the risk factors for melanoma have complex interactions. In order to offer tailored clinical management strategies, we developed a New Zealand prediction model to estimate individual 5-year absolute risk of melanoma. Methods A population-based case–control study (368 cases and 270 controls) of melanoma risk factors provided estimates of relative risks for fair-skinned New Zealanders aged 20–79 years. Model selection techniques and multivariate logistic regression were used to determine the important predictors. The relative risks for predictors were combined with baseline melanoma incidence rates and non-melanoma mortality rates to calculate individual probabilities of developing melanoma within 5~years. Results For women, the best model included skin colour, number of moles\,{$>$}\,=5~mm on the right arm, having a 1st degree relative with large moles, and a personal history of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC). The model correctly classified 68\% of participants; the C-statistic was 0.74. For men, the best model included age, place of occupation up to age 18~years, number of moles\,{$>$}\,=5~mm on the right arm, birthplace, and a history of NMSC. The model correctly classified 67\% of cases; the C-statistic was 0.71. Conclusions We have developed the first New Zealand risk prediction model that calculates individual absolute 5-year risk of melanoma. This model will aid physicians to identify individuals at high risk, allowing them to individually target surveillance and other management strategies, and thereby reduce the high melanoma burden in New Zealand.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to present the epidemiological, clinicopathological, and treatment characteristics of patients diagnosed and treated in a tertiary referral center and to analyze independent factors associated with these characteristics. In this cohort study, epidemiological, clinicopathological, and treatment characteristics of 1461 consecutive melanoma patients diagnosed and treated in a tertiary referral center in 1987–2015 were prospectively collected in a registry. All patients underwent resection of their melanoma lesion. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to examine independent correlations between characteristics. Internal validation of these correlations was performed by the bootstrap method. The median age of the patients was 53 years. Female sex had a slight predominance, whereas the majority were of Southern European origin. Superficial spreading melanoma was associated with younger age (P{$<$}0.001), whereas the nodular melanoma histological subtype was associated independently with indoor occupation (P=0.021) and diagnosis in the years 2004–2015 (P=0.002). Melanomas with Breslow thickness above 1.0\,mm were associated with skin type III–IV (P=0.021) and diagnosis in the years 1987–2003 (P=0.046). In addition, histological ulceration was associated with older age (P=0.004) and diagnosis in the years 1987–2003 (P{$<$}0.001), whereas histological regression was associated independently with older age (P=0.001). This study presented independent associations between epidemiological, histopathological, and treatment characteristics, which might help to better understand melanoma disease and treatment practices in Southern Europe.},

  abstract = {New melanoma therapies are being developed rapidly, complementing prevention and detection strategies for disease control. Estimating the future burden of melanoma is necessary for deciding how best to deploy limited resources to achieve effective melanoma control. Using three decades of cancer registry data (1982-2011) from six populations with moderate to high melanoma incidence (US whites and the populations of the United Kingdom, Sweden, Norway, Australia, New Zealand), we applied age-period-cohort models to describe current trends and project future incidence rates and numbers of melanomas out to 2031. Between 1982 and 2011, melanoma rates in US whites, and the populations of the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Norway increased at more than 3\% annually and are projected to continue rising until at least 2022. Melanoma incidence in Australia has been declining since 2005 (-0.7\% per year), and melanoma incidence in New Zealand is increasing but is projected to decline soon. The numbers of new melanoma cases will rise in all six populations because of aging populations and high age-specific rates in the elderly. In US whites, annual new cases will rise from around 70,000 in 2007-2011 to 116,000 in 2026-2031, with 79\% of the increase attributable to rising age-specific rates and 21\% to population growth and aging. The continued increases in case numbers in all six populations through 2031 will increase the challenges of melanoma control.},
